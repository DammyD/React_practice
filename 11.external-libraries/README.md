# What Are External Libraries?
External Libraries are essential building blocks for any React app. An external library/package is a reusable component/function created by other developers. 

## Importance of External Libraries
- They help to increase the overall speed and performance of your app when selected carefully and can also negatively affect the speed and performance when you utilize the wrong one.
- The main idea behind using external libraries is to ensure you don’t have to recreate functions that already exist, this overall helps to keep with the DRY principle of programming. 

### Why Use External Libraries?
-  it helps save time and productivity: You just have to install the library you would like to use and import it in the particular js file you want and you can utilize the particular functionality.
- It also helps to reduce the “run time” for the application. The more code you have in your application, the increase in compiler time.
- Another advantage is fewer bugs are introduced into the app, and an external library has been tested and modified over time. You just have to find the right library to give the exact type of result you want

**Installing A React Library**
There are two different ways to install a React Library
- Using NPM
`npm install -g npm`( This install npm globally)
`npm -v`(Check npm version)
cd ***project name***(To go into project directory)
Use npm install ***library name*** (Install library in your react app)

- Using Yarn 
`npm install –global yarn` (This installs yarn globally)
`yarn version` (check yarn version)
cd ***project name*** (To go into project directory)
Use yarn add ***library name***(Install library in your react app)

#### Using Component Libraries

**What are Component Libraries?**

React Component Libraries offer ready-made and ready-to-use components for React applications. 

They help developers create:
- modern
-  attractive 
-  responsive web designs for applications
- help to drive scalability and stability for apps. 

Any Library that only handles logic is called a **utility library**

**package-lock.json** helps to manage the version of the package or library that you install
**yarn.lock**
