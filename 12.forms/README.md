# Forms in React

## Unconrolled React Form
A controlled form is one that is controlled by the React state while an Uncontrolled is not controlled by the React state but working on the default value in the input field.

Every input field have a value attribute and so evrytime you type inside the field the value attr. is updated, you can then get the value out without even writing the value attr. in the input declaration.

The Uncontrolled Form is saying that you do not need the React state to get the value. However, there are cases where the unconrolled implement will not be beneficial and that's in a case you need to make use of that value to do something else. In that case you would not need to use a controlled method
